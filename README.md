## Hi there 👋

### About me

Hi, I'm Kasia. I love trying new things — and coding is one of them.

I joined GitHub recently; my first commit was on April 5, 2025. 
I really got going three months later, in June 2025, when I started having fun with [Small Projects — katawiecz](https://github.com/katawiecz/small_projects_katawiecz). 
And I was hooked.

The gates to these unknown lands have just opened for me — and opened wide. 
I can’t believe how much I can create! 
I’m not a lifelong programmer; Not yet...
I’m a curious person who lights up whenever there’s a “let’s try” in the air.
